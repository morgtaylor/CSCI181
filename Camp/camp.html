	<p>Hi! I am excited to meet you all! I have been enjoying the outdoors since I was born. More recently I have found a passion for showing others the outside, hence the reason i started this camp! I am excited for you all to join me and enjoy the wilderness as much as I do. I have been hunting since I was 12, fishing mostly in the last few years and outside my entire life.</p>

	<p>Hi! Jacob here, I love being outside! Hunting, fishing, swimming, hiking, camping, backpacking, you name it I've done it and enjoy it! Most recently I have spent my time focusing on hunting sponosorships to become a professional hunter!</p>

	<p>Hi, I'm Gabe! I currently serve in the Montana National Guard here in Missoula. I have known Jacob for the last 14 years and have had tons of exhilerating adventures with him since. As you probably guessed, I love the outdoors as much as the last two as well. While I don't spend much time at the camp, my main focus is the survival skills section of camp!</p>
