<h3>Volunteer Experience</h3>
<h4>Key Club & Kiwanis Club (2006-2019)</h4>
<p>I started volunteering for Kiwanis Club as a young child with my dad. This helped grow my love for helping others as well as taught me skills such as organization, communication, cleanliness, and most importantly hardwork. As I grew older, I decided to join Key Club in high school. While I learned so many skills from being involved with Key Club the most important ones came from being in leadership positions. From being the social media/webmaster for my club from 2017-2018 taught me how to plan, organize and lead events as well as how to effectively and efficiently run a social media page and create advertisements for around the school and the community. Lastly, from 2018-2019 I resided as Key Club President. Being in this role taught me a lot about how to be a good leader and how to run a club/organization effectively.</p>
<h4>TOPSoccer (2017-2019)</h4>
<p>TOPSoccer is a wonderful organization that allows kids with special needs to come to the fields and play soccer! From this I gained a lot of experience working with people from all different backgrounds. This experience taught me how to learn from others, even those younger than me. It taught me patience as well as how to teach other skills and knowledge through various learning styles. </p>
